# Aahaar — Project Memory / Progress Log

> **Purpose:** single source of truth for project status. Claude reads this FIRST when resuming, and updates it after each implementation step — so we never have to re-read the whole codebase to know where we are.
>
> **📎 To resume in a new chat:** point Claude at this file — `C:\Projects\aahaar\MEMORY.md`. It reads this, then continues from the "Next up" list. Update it after every implementation step.
>
> **Last updated:** 2026-07-02 · **Current state:** core loop + onboarding/goals + 4 tabs + splash + backup/restore + quantity edit + calendar day-tap + streaks. **Seed = 287 foods** with top-up sync on app update. **Manual entry** (user-provided kcal/macros). **Full theming**: light/dark (system/manual) + **5 accent colors** (saffron/emerald/ocean/berry/violet), persisted in `app_setting`, Settings→Appearance. **Landing page LIVE ✅** at `https://aahaar-site.pages.dev` (Cloudflare Pages, direct-upload via wrangler — NOT git-connected; redeploy = `npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name aahaar-site` from `C:\Projects\aahaar-site`). GitHub remote still not created (optional, for git-connected auto-deploys). **Cloudflare: worker DEPLOYED ✅** (2026-07-02) at `https://aahaar-parser.aahaar.workers.dev` (subdomain `aahaar.workers.dev` registered via API); `GROQ_API_KEY` secret set; `EXPO_PUBLIC_PARSER_URL` added to `mobile/.env` (restart Expo with `-c` to pick it up). Before prod build: REMOVE `EXPO_PUBLIC_GROQ_KEY` from `.env`. Import-error debug still pending user's error text.
>
> **AI runtime note:** **llm7.io is now PRIMARY** (2026-07-02). Order = cache → Worker → Ollama → **OpenAI-compat(llm7.io)** → Groq → offline, in both `parseMeal.ts` and `aiEstimate.ts`. Groq is the fallback. `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini`. To revert, swap the llm7/Groq blocks back.

## What this is
**Aahaar** (working name) — a privacy-first, AI-driven calorie & macro tracker for an **Indian audience**. Core UX: type a meal in plain language / Hinglish ("2 roti aur ek katori dal") → AI parses → local nutrition DB computes calories & macros → daily dashboard + calendar + trends.

## Locked decisions
- **Platform:** React Native + Expo (TypeScript). Cross-platform iOS + Android.
- **Dev setup:** Windows machine (no Mac). Build iOS via **Expo EAS** cloud builds. Dev has an **iPhone** + can run **Android emulator** → full cross-platform testing.
- **Storage:** **privacy-first, local-first**. All user data on-device in **SQLite (`expo-sqlite`)**. No cloud DB / server / accounts in MVP.
- **AI:** does **language parsing only** (returns `{food, quantity, unit}`, never calorie numbers). Numbers come from the local nutrition DB. Only meal text (no PII) leaves the device.
- **AI model:** **cloud-hosted inference** (confirmed 2026-07-01 — NOT local Ollama). **Groq (Llama 3.3)** free tier is the recommended provider; called via a thin **Cloudflare Worker proxy** that holds the key and forwards only meal text. Ollama Cloud is an acceptable alternative if we want to stay in the Ollama ecosystem. Model layer stays swappable.
- **ORM:** **Drizzle** over `expo-sqlite` (confirmed 2026-07-01) — type-safe queries.
- **Backup:** CSV/JSON export + optional user-owned cloud backup.

## Recommended, NOT yet confirmed by user
- **Cloud provider:** Groq recommended; user confirmed "cloud not local" but hasn't picked Groq vs Ollama Cloud explicitly. Groq is the working assumption.
- **Product name** "Aahaar" is a placeholder.

## Repo
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/SudhanshuPanthri/Aahaar (pushed 2026-07-02, branch `main`). Single repo rooted at `C:\Projects\aahaar` (mobile/ was a nested git repo from Expo scaffold — its `.git` removed so it's tracked by the parent). `.gitignore` at root + `mobile/.gitignore` **exclude `.env`** (keep `.env.example`) and `node_modules`. **The real Groq key lives only in `mobile/.env` — never commit it.** git user: SudhanshuPanthri / panthrisudhanshu666@gmail.com. Push worked via Windows credential helper (gh not logged in).

## Artifacts
- `BRD.md` (v0.2) — full business requirements.
- `TECH_DESIGN.md` — SQLite schema, AI extraction JSON schema, resolution pipeline.
- `MEMORY.md` — this file.

## Progress

### ✅ Done
- [x] BRD written and iterated (privacy-first, local-first, calendar, trends, native→RN pivot).
- [x] Tech stack decided (RN + Expo, expo-sqlite, EAS).
- [x] Data model designed (SQLite tables: food, food_portion, profile, weight_log, goal, log_item, parse_cache).
- [x] AI extraction JSON schema designed.
- [x] Estimation/resolution pipeline designed.

### ✅ Done (continued)
- [x] Seed nutrition dataset **starter** (~55 foods) → `data/seed_foods.json` (marked `curated-approx`; expand to ~250 + validate vs IFCT before launch).
- [x] **Expo app scaffolded** at `mobile/` (blank-typescript, SDK 57). Deps: `expo-sqlite`, `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`.
- [x] **DB layer wired**: `mobile/src/db/{schema,ddl,client,seed,init}.ts` — Drizzle schema, raw DDL (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS at startup), single expo-sqlite connection, seed loader (loads `seed_foods.json` into `food`/`food_portion` on first run, idempotent).
- [x] **Estimation resolver** → `mobile/src/estimate/resolve.ts` (name/alias match → unit→grams → compute macros + confidence).
- [x] **Demo screen** → `mobile/App.tsx` proves the loop: inits DB, seeds, resolves a hardcoded parsed meal, shows per-item + total calories/macros. **`npx tsc --noEmit` passes.**
- [x] Verified expo-sqlite API against Expo v57 docs (openDatabaseSync/execAsync confirmed).
- [x] **App runs on device** (Android emulator confirmed by user) — demo list renders. (Fixed: App.tsx write had failed earlier and left the default template.)
- [x] **AI parser built**:
  - `worker/` — Cloudflare Worker proxy → Groq (`src/index.ts`, `wrangler.toml`, `README.md` deploy guide). Holds the key; only meal text passes through. NOT deployed yet (needs user's Cloudflare + Groq key).
  - `mobile/src/ai/remoteParse.ts` — calls the worker (URL via `EXPO_PUBLIC_PARSER_URL`).
  - `mobile/src/ai/localParse.ts` — offline heuristic parser (Hinglish numbers/units/foods) → works with no key/network; also the app's offline mode.
  - `mobile/src/ai/parseMeal.ts` — uses AI if configured, else local fallback; returns `via: 'ai'|'local'`.
- [x] **Input screen** (`App.tsx`): free-text box → parseMeal → estimateMeal → list; **total pinned as a fixed footer**, list scrolls independently. Typecheck passes.
- [x] **Dev direct-Groq path** (`mobile/src/ai/groq.ts`): set `EXPO_PUBLIC_GROQ_KEY` to use real AI without deploying the Worker (dev only — key is bundled into JS, never ship). `parseMeal` order: Worker → direct Groq → offline `localParse`.
- [x] **AI nutrition estimation for DB misses** (`mobile/src/estimate/estimateMeal.ts`): DB-first for known foods; if unmatched + AI available, Groq estimates the food's nutrition (flagged `estimatedBy: 'ai'`, confidence low, shown as "AI est." in UI). This is how the AI "calculates" for foods outside the seed list.

- [x] **AI enabled (dev):** user set `EXPO_PUBLIC_GROQ_KEY` in `mobile/.env` → `parseMeal` now uses real Groq parsing; DB misses get AI nutrition estimates.
- [x] **Save to log_item** (`mobile/src/db/log.ts`): `addLogItems` (snapshots macros, infers meal slot, `local_date`=today), `getDayTotals`, `todayLocalDate`. Wired into `App.tsx`: "Add to today" button + a **TODAY** total card that reads from the log.
- [x] **iOS-inspired font:** Inter via `@expo-google-fonts/inter` + `expo-font` (SF Pro substitute; SF itself isn't licensable to bundle). Applied across all text. Full UI polish deferred per user.
- [x] **Today's log view** (`getDayItems`, `deleteLogItem` in `log.ts`): the main list shows saved items for today (with ✕ delete) when not mid-estimate; shows the pending "THIS MEAL" estimate while estimating. Add-to-today refreshes both totals and the list.
- [x] **Multi-provider AI + caching** (to fight Groq rate limits):
  - `src/ai/shared.ts` — shared prompts + normalizers.
  - `src/ai/ollama.ts` — **local Ollama** provider (unlimited/free/private; `EXPO_PUBLIC_OLLAMA_URL` + `_MODEL`). Uses `/api/chat` with `format:'json'`.
  - `src/ai/groq.ts` — refactored to use shared.
  - `src/ai/aiEstimate.ts` — provider-agnostic estimate (Ollama → Groq).
  - `src/db/parseCache.ts` — `getCachedParse`/`putCachedParse` (upsert). `parseMeal` checks cache first (via `'cache'`), caches AI results. **Repeated meals never re-hit the model.**
  - Provider order in `parseMeal`: cache → Worker → Ollama → Groq → offline.
  - Reminder: no free hosted model is truly unlimited; "unlimited" = self-host (local Ollama for dev; a server for prod).
- [x] **Onboarding + goals** (2026-07-02):
  - `src/goals/calc.ts` — pure Mifflin–St Jeor: BMR → TDEE (activity factors) → goal delta (lose −500 / gain +350) → macro split (protein 1.6 g/kg, fat 25%, carbs remainder). Calorie floor 1500♂/1200♀.
  - `src/db/profile.ts` — get/save singleton `profile`, add/get latest `weight_log`, get/save active `goal` (newest wins), `hasCompletedOnboarding()`.
  - `src/screens/Onboarding.tsx` — Guided (demographics form) / Custom (enter kcal) modes with live target preview; writes profile+weight+goal. Reused as "Edit goal" (prefills existing).
  - `App.tsx` — first run shows Onboarding; Today card shows **progress bars** vs goal (kcal + P/C/F, over-goal turns red) + "Edit goal" link. (Bars not SVG rings — avoids native rebuild; proper rings deferred to UI pass.)
- [x] **Generic OpenAI-compatible AI provider** (2026-07-02): `src/ai/openaiCompat.ts` — works with ANY `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint via `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_BASE_URL`/`_KEY`(optional)/`_MODEL`. Lenient JSON extraction (no `response_format`, since free proxies reject it). Wired into `parseMeal` (…→Groq→OpenAI-compat→offline) and `aiEstimate`. **Recommended free provider: llm7.io** (`https://api.llm7.io/v1`, no signup, ~150 req/min > Groq's 30/min; models at `/v1/models`). g4f.dev/uncloseai also work by config. From user-shared repo github.com/zebbern/no-cost-ai.

- [x] **Splash screen** (2026-07-02): `expo-splash-screen` config plugin in app.json (uses `assets/splash-icon.png`, white bg); `App.tsx` holds native splash via `preventAutoHideAsync` until fonts+DB ready then `hideAsync`. App display name → "Aahaar". Skipped `setOptions`/fade (warns in Expo Go). Config-plugin visuals only apply in a dev/prod build, not Expo Go.
- [x] **Bottom-tab navigation** (2026-07-02): chose **state-based tabs** (no expo-router — avoided a risky blind entry-point migration). `App.tsx` = init/splash/onboarding gate + tab bar (🍽️ Log / 📅 Calendar / 📈 Trends); renders only the active tab so each remounts with fresh DB reads.
  - `src/ui/theme.ts` (FONT + COLORS tokens), `src/ui/Progress.tsx` (ProgressBar + MacroStat, extracted from App).
  - `src/screens/LogScreen.tsx` — the old main UI, now self-contained.
  - `src/screens/CalendarScreen.tsx` — month grid, per-day kcal dot coloured under/on/over goal, ‹ › month nav, month summary.
  - `src/screens/TrendsScreen.tsx` — 7/30-day averages (per **logged** day) + last-7-days kcal bar chart. Uses `src/db/stats.ts` (`getDailyTotalsInRange`, `getAverages`, `shiftLocalDate`).
- [x] **Meal-grouped display + parse fix** (2026-07-02): user complaint — "5 eggs cheese toast" showed 3 ingredient rows each with qty 5, and they only want to see the line they typed.
  - Display: `log.ts` `getDayMeals()` groups items by shared `loggedAt` into one **Meal** (title = raw typed text; total kcal; small ×qty breakdown only if >1 item); `deleteMeal()` removes the whole meal. Estimate preview now leads with the typed line + total, breakdown is a secondary dim line. Footer total merged into the Add button.
  - Parse: hardened `PARSE_SYSTEM` (shared.ts) — a number binds ONLY to the next food, others default to qty 1, never copy one number across foods; added few-shot examples. (Root cause was the AI parser; offline `localParse` already kept it as one chunk.)

- [x] **"Why boiled egg?" fix** (2026-07-02): root cause = `resolve.ts` displayed the matched DB row's `canonicalName` instead of the user's word, and the seed's generic egg was named `"egg (boiled)"`. Fix: `Estimate.name` now = the parsed/user term (added `matchedName` for the DB row as metadata only, not shown); renamed seed `egg (boiled)` → `egg` (both `mobile/src/data/` and root `data/` copies; aliases now include scrambled egg/eggs/ande). NOTE: seed rename only affects **fresh** installs (seedIfEmpty); the display fix works on existing DBs. Remaining caveat: nutrition still comes from the generic egg row (~155 kcal/100g) — scrambled-in-oil under-counts fat; finer variants are a seed-expansion (post-MVP) matter.

- [x] **Seed expansion → 106 foods** (2026-07-02): added ~54 common composite dishes (masala dosa, biryani, paneer gravies, chaat, indo-chinese, sweets, breads, beverages…) as single-entry foods so common meals resolve from DB with NO AI call. `curated-approx`; still validate vs IFCT before launch. Both copies (`mobile/src/data/` + root `data/`) kept identical. (Storage is a non-issue: ~150 KB.)
- [x] **Saved meals** (2026-07-02): user-curated dishes/combinations re-logged with one tap, bypassing AI + resolver (stores resolved `Estimate[]` JSON). `saved_meal` table (schema.ts + ddl.ts), `db/savedMeals.ts` (save/list/getItems/markUsed/delete/exists). LogScreen: **star icon (☆/★)** saves a meal — both on the estimate card AND on each already-logged meal in TODAY'S LOG (footer is a single full-width "Add to today"). Saving a logged meal uses `saveMealFromLog` (rebuilds `Estimate[]` from stored log rows, no AI). Horizontal "SAVED MEALS · tap to log" chip row (with ✕ delete) when idle; sorted most-used first; star shows filled when a meal of that name is already saved.
- [x] **Tab icons** (2026-07-02): swapped emoji for **Ionicons** (`@expo/vector-icons`) — restaurant / calendar / stats-chart, filled+orange when active, outline+grey when not.

- [x] **Local backup / restore (account-free)** (2026-07-02): `db/backup.ts` (`buildBackup` dumps profile/goal/weight_log/log_item/saved_meal to JSON; `restoreBackup` replaces them in one `expo.withTransactionSync`). `backup/backupFile.ts` — export writes JSON to cache (new SDK57 `File`/`Paths` API) then `Sharing.shareAsync` (OS save-to Drive/iCloud/Files); import via `DocumentPicker` → read → restore. **Settings tab** (`SettingsScreen.tsx`, 4th tab, gear icon) hosts Export/Import + Edit goal. Import re-checks onboarding and remounts screens via `dataEpoch` key. **Architecture note:** no OAuth/accounts — OS mediates the user's own cloud; we only produce/read a file. (OAuth Drive/iCloud auto-sync = deferred v2 below.)

- [x] **Per-item quantity edit** (2026-07-02): `log.ts` — `Meal.items` (underlying rows) + `updateLogItemQuantity(id, qty)` (rescales snapshotted grams/kcal/macros by newQty/oldQty — no AI/re-resolution). LogScreen: tap a logged meal card → expands into item rows with −/+ steppers (step 1; 0.5 stop between 1 and min) + per-item trash (deleting the last item removes the meal).
- [x] **Calendar: tap a day → that day's meals** (2026-07-02): cells are Pressable (selected = orange outline); panel below the grid lists the day's meals (`getDayMeals(date)`) with kcal/macros/breakdown; tap again or change month to deselect.
- [x] **Production-polish pass #1** (2026-07-02, user asked to treat as a production app): delete **confirmations** (logged meal + saved meal, destructive Alert); Today card shows **"N left / N over"** vs goal (green/red) + **🔥 streak badge** (shown at 2+); today's log grouped under **meal-slot headers** (BREAKFAST/LUNCH/…, removed from per-card line); subtle card shadows; Trends **stat tiles** (🔥 day streak via `getLoggingStreak()` in stats.ts — consecutive logged days, unlogged *today* doesn't break it; ✓ days within goal ≤ target×1.05 in the window).
- [x] **Import-error groundwork** (2026-07-02): user reported a JSON import error (details pending). Verified `File.textSync()` IS valid in expo-file-system v57 (checked docs), so the read path is API-correct. `restoreBackup` now wraps per-table inserts → errors read "Restore failed at log_item row 12 of 300: …" instead of a bare SQLite message. **Waiting on the user's actual error text.**

- [x] **Seed expansion → 287 foods** (2026-07-02): +181 across all categories (incl. health foods, street/fast food, alcohol, condiments); generator script kept in session scratchpad only; both JSON copies identical. `seedIfEmpty` → **`syncSeed`** (top-up: inserts seed foods missing from DB by canonical name on every init, so app updates deliver new foods; ids = max+1; never overwrites). Still `curated-approx` — IFCT validation pending.
- [x] **Manual entry** (2026-07-02, user request): `ManualEntry.tsx` bottom-sheet (name, qty/unit, TOTAL kcal + optional P/C/F) via "Manual" button beside Estimate; logs with `estimatedBy:'user'` → `log_item.source='user'` (Estimate union + addLogItems updated); works with qty steppers.
- [x] **Theming — dark mode + 5 accents** (2026-07-02, user request, built via subagent): `ui/theme.tsx` (renamed from .ts) = LIGHT/DARK palettes + ACCENTS (saffron default/emerald/ocean/berry/violet — accent replaces `calories`/`accent`/`accentSoft` tokens; protein/carbs/fat/danger fixed) + ThemeProvider/useTheme. Persisted in new **`app_setting`** table (`theme_pref`, `accent_color`) via `db/settings.ts` (lazy CREATE TABLE guard). All screens = `makeStyles(colors)` pattern, zero hex outside theme.tsx; StatusBar + keyboardAppearance adapt. Settings → APPEARANCE (segmented System/Light/Dark + swatch row).
- [x] **Landing page** (2026-07-02, user request): separate repo **`C:\Projects\aahaar-site`** (user wants independent hosting) — self-contained `index.html`, app design tokens, CSS phone mock, features/how/privacy sections, dark toggle + same 5 accent swatches (localStorage). Committed locally; **user must create the GitHub remote** (`git remote add origin …aahaar-site.git && git push -u origin main`), then host via Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Pages.

### 🔜 Next up (not started)
- [ ] **User re-tests backup import** — fix shipped 2026-07-02 (see changelog: legacy `readAsStringAsync` fallback in `backupFile.ts`); awaiting confirmation on device.
- [ ] **Remove `EXPO_PUBLIC_GROQ_KEY` from `mobile/.env` before any production build** — the deployed worker now covers the Groq path, so the dev key must not ship in the app bundle. (llm7.io is keyless so direct-from-app is fine in prod.)
- [ ] **(Optional) Push aahaar-site to GitHub** (user creates repo) and connect it to the Pages project for auto-deploys — site is already live via direct upload.
- [ ] **Cloud AUTO-sync v2 (user request, "for later"):** the manual export/import above already covers device-switch. v2 = automatic background sync to the user's own cloud — Google Drive (needs `expo-auth-session` OAuth) / iCloud (needs native entitlements + dev build). Keep privacy-first (user-owned storage, not our server). Only build if manual proves insufficient. data is local-only (SQLite), so switching devices loses history. Provide opt-in sync to the user's own cloud — **Google Drive** (Android) + **iCloud/Files** (iOS) — to export/import the DB or a JSON dump so a new device can restore. Design notes: privacy-first (user-owned storage, not our server); simplest v1 = export whole DB / JSON to Drive/iCloud + import on new device; later = auto background sync w/ conflict handling. Overlaps with existing "CSV/JSON export" backup decision — build export first, then cloud targets. Libraries: `expo-file-system` + `expo-sharing` for export; Google Drive via GDrive REST + `expo-auth-session`, iCloud via iOS Files/document picker.
- [ ] Calendar/Trends niceties: year view (day-tap ✅ done).
- [ ] Expand seed dataset toward ~250 foods; validate vs IFCT 2017.
- [ ] Full UI/design pass (per user: "work on UI later").

### 📌 Repo notes
- `mobile/AGENTS.md` (via `CLAUDE.md`) says: read the exact Expo **v57** docs (https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/) before writing Expo code. Honor this.

### ▶️ How to run (Windows) + known gotchas
- **Run from `mobile/`**, not repo root: `cd C:\Projects\aahaar\mobile && npx expo start`. (Root has no package.json → `ConfigError`.)
- Expo Go **"request timed out"** on LAN → use **tunnel**: `npx expo start --tunnel`.
- Tunnel error **"Install @expo/ngrok and try again"** even after global install → install it **locally**: `npm install --save-dev @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0` (already done). Then `--tunnel` works.
- Zero-network fallback: press **`a`** for Android emulator (no phone/network needed) to sanity-check the app.
- [ ] Onboarding (Guided goal calc via Mifflin–St Jeor / Custom).
- [ ] Meal logging screen + AI proxy + parse→confirm→save loop.
- [ ] Daily dashboard (calories + 3 macro rings).
- [ ] Calendar view.
- [ ] Trends dashboard (avg macros, week/month/year).
- [ ] Export/backup.

### 🧠 Open questions (deferred, non-blocking)
- Login providers if/when cloud sync is ever added.
- Regional-language input beyond Hinglish.
- Monetization (free / freemium / coach-B2B).

### 📦 Post-MVP features (specced, deferred)
- **Barcode scanning** for packaged foods — full spec in `BRD.md` §16. Uses `expo-camera` + Open Food Facts lookup by barcode; caches to a `custom_food` table for offline reuse; only the barcode number leaves the device. Build in Phase 3.

## Changelog
- **2026-07-03** — User enrolled own email → confirmed stored in KV, but "nothing happened" = UX: success feedback too subtle + no confirmation email (none exists by design; sending would need a custom domain + provider like Resend — noted as a domain-purchase reason). Fixed: on success the form is replaced by a prominent green confirmation pill (`34b71ae` site repo). Hero note now says **Android beta** first, "iOS comes later" (user: promising iOS was misleading). **Dashboard header now the आhaar lockup** (`e04e5d7`): nested Text, आ in system Devanagari (= Noto Sans Devanagari on Android, brand-exact) accent-coloured + "haar" Inter bold ink; verified in dev build. Gotchas hit: `expo start` MUST run from mobile/ AND a zombie node held port 8081 answering nothing — kill via Get-NetTCPConnection before restarting; background commands shouldn't redirect all output to /dev/null (hides failures).
- **2026-07-02 (latest)** — **Early-access enrollment LIVE on the site**: hero email form → `functions/api/enroll.js` (Pages Function) → **KV namespace `WAITLIST`** (id `c03f894edcd640e0bda21e09f53727de`, bound to the Pages project via CF API PATCH). Validated end-to-end (test emails stored + deleted). View list: `npx wrangler kv key list --namespace-id c03f894... --remote` (**--remote is required** — wrangler v4 KV defaults to a local dev store). Hero CTA now the enroll form; "View on GitHub" ghost button kept. **Beta plan discussed with user**: interim = EAS preview APK on GitHub Releases emailed to waitlist; proper = Play Closed Testing ($25, waitlist emails = tester list, satisfies Play's pre-launch testing requirement) + TestFlight for iOS ($99/yr). Bug reporting: recommended in-app mailto reporter w/ device info (NOT BUILT YET — user hasn't confirmed) + GitHub issues. **Polished README.md** pushed (brand wordmark w/ dark variant `brand/wordmark-dark.svg`, features, privacy architecture, stack, run instructions, roadmap; verified SVGs serve 200).
- **2026-07-02 (earlier)** — **Import fix CONFIRMED working by user on device.** **Calorie engine accuracy pass** (subagent build, verified: 11 matcher tests + typecheck ✓, pushed `91dae94`): `estimate/rank.ts` ranked matching (exact>alias>token-cover w/ extra-word penalty>substring; fixes 'paneer'→paneer-butter-masala class of errors), category-aware portion defaults + unit synonyms in resolve.ts, `validateAiNutrition` (density clamps + 4-4-9 reconciliation) in aiEstimate.ts, +19 seed portion rows (both copies), syncSeed now tops up portion rows on existing installs, test via `node scripts/test-matcher.mjs`. NEXT accuracy step (user aware, not started): IFCT 2017 validation sweep of all 287 per-100g values. **Landing-page mystery SOLVED**: user's 'misalignment' = ALL section vertical padding was zero — `.wrap{padding:0 24px}` (class) beat `section{padding:56px 0}` (element) in specificity. Fixed as `section.wrap{padding:56px 24px}` + scroll-margin-top for sticky nav. SAME bug mirror-image on the hero: `.hero{padding:72px 0 56px}` (later rule) killed .wrap's horizontal 24px → hero flush to screen edge on mobile; fixed with explicit 24px. Both deployed + visually verified via emulator Chrome screenshots. LESSON: verify deploys VISUALLY, not just by curl-ing the served CSS; audit .wrap-combined class rules for padding collisions.
- **2026-07-02 (earlier)** — **Dev build verified on emulator**: gradle build succeeded (needs `JAVA_HOME`=Android Studio jbr + `ANDROID_HOME`=%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk — NOT set globally yet, export per-shell), APK installed on Pixel_9_Pro AVD, आ icon confirmed on launcher (screenshot). `mobile/android/` exists now (gitignored). **Wordmark added** per user: "आhaar" (आ Devanagari saffron + "haar" Noto Sans Bold ink) — `brand/make-wordmark.mjs` → `brand/wordmark.svg` (opentype.js gotcha: use `charToGlyph().getPath()` for Devanagari, `font.getPath()` emits NaN). Landing nav now uses the wordmark (theme-aware via .aa/.haar classes). **App icon is the ONE-LINE lockup** (user iterated: stacked → one line): आhaar on a shared baseline — `brand/make-icon-mark.mjs` → `icon-mark.svg`; generator two-tones by default, flattens to one colour for monochrome. Verified on emulator launcher (screenshot). Brand preview artifact: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/8a7a608d-cbfa-49c4-aa71-3e2515bc230d opentype.js 2nd gotcha: layout at small fractional font sizes emits NaN — extract at size 100 + fit with an SVG transform. Nemotron 3 Ultra question answered: usable via existing openaiCompat provider (OpenRouter :free / NVIDIA NIM), recommended against as primary (550B reasoning model = slow for parse UX); not wired.
- **2026-07-02 (earlier)** — **Brand identity shipped**: user picked the **आ monogram** (concept B of 3; artifact page shown). Hand-drawn versions kept mis-reading (ना) per user → final mark = the **real आ glyph outline extracted from Noto Sans Devanagari Bold** (SIL OFL, font kept at `brand/fonts/`; `brand/extract-glyph.mjs` via opentype.js writes the path into logo.svg). Master SVG = `brand/logo.svg`; generator = `brand/generate-icons.mjs` (reads logo.svg, recolours) (sharp; `npm install && node generate-icons.mjs` from brand/, node_modules gitignored) → writes mobile/assets: icon.png (1024 cream #fdf1e9 + saffron mark), android-icon-foreground/monochrome (safe-zone 560px/1024), splash-icon.png (512 transparent), favicon.png. app.json: adaptiveIcon bg → #fdf1e9 (backgroundImage removed + file deleted), splash bg → cream, imageWidth 160. **Landing page**: mark added as favicon (SVG data URI) + nav logo lockup; overflow-x clip fix; redeployed. NOTE: icon/splash visuals only show in a dev/prod build, not Expo Go. **Animations SHIPPED** (subagent build, typecheck ✓, user to verify in Expo Go): installed `react-native-reanimated` 4.5 + `react-native-worklets` (v57 docs: NO babel config needed — babel-preset-expo auto-configures). New `ui/PressableScale.tsx` (press scale 0.97 + opacity, adopted by all buttons/chips/tab bar); Progress bars animate width (450ms out-cubic, grow from 0); tab switch = FadeInDown 220ms keyed on tab+dataEpoch; LogScreen estimate card FadeInDown, meal cards FadeIn/FadeOut + LinearTransition (animated expand/collapse), streak badge ZoomIn; ManualEntry = shared-value bottom sheet (slide+backdrop fade, animates out before close); Calendar month grid slides ‹/› directionally, day panel FadeInDown. Gotcha fixed: `StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject` missing from RN 0.86 types.
- **2026-07-02 (earlier)** — **Import-error FIXED**: user's screenshot showed `FileSystemFile.textSync` rejected with "Missing 'READ' permission" (Android). Known Expo bug (expo/expo#21792): new `File` API permission check can reject picker URIs even with `copyToCacheDirectory: true`. Fix in `backup/backupFile.ts`: try `File.textSync()` first, catch → legacy `readAsStringAsync(uri)` (reads file:// AND content:// via content resolver). Typecheck ✓; user to re-test on device. Also fixed landing-page misalignment (step-card chips now bottom-aligned via flex column + `margin-top:auto`) → committed in aahaar-site + redeployed to Pages; `.wrangler/` gitignored there.
- **2026-07-02 (earlier)** — **Landing page deployed** to Cloudflare Pages: created project `aahaar-site` + direct-upload deploy from `C:\Projects\aahaar-site` → live at `https://aahaar-site.pages.dev` (verified 200). Direct-upload mode (no git connection); redeploy by re-running `wrangler pages deploy`. First request after deploy returned a transient 522 (cold start) — retry, it's fine.
- **2026-07-02 (earlier)** — **Cloudflare Worker deployed**: user ran `wrangler login`; registered account subdomain `aahaar.workers.dev` via CF API (wrangler 4 has no CLI command for it; new-subdomain TLS cert takes ~1 min to provision); set `GROQ_API_KEY` secret; deployed → `https://aahaar-parser.aahaar.workers.dev`; curl-tested Hinglish parse ✓. **Gotcha:** piping the secret via PowerShell 5.1 appended `\r` → Groq 401 "Invalid API Key"; fixed by re-uploading via bash `printf '%s'`. Added `EXPO_PUBLIC_PARSER_URL` to `mobile/.env` (parseMeal now: cache → Worker → Ollama → llm7 → Groq → offline; restart Expo with `-c`). Remaining: strip `EXPO_PUBLIC_GROQ_KEY` before prod build.
- **2026-07-02 (earlier)** — Theming shipped (dark mode + 5 accents, app_setting persistence, all screens tokenized — subagent build, verified + pushed `8a11498`). Seed 106→287 + syncSeed top-up + ManualEntry (pushed `057d011`). Quantity-edit/calendar-tap/streak/polish batch pushed `2bf6484`. Landing page repo created at C:\Projects\aahaar-site (2 local commits, no remote yet). Cloudflare: account ✓, wrangler installed; awaiting user's `wrangler login`.
- **2026-07-02 (earlier)** — Per-item quantity edit (expandable meal cards, −/+ steppers, per-item delete; `updateLogItemQuantity` rescales macros). Calendar day-tap → day's meals panel. Polish: delete confirmations, kcal left/over on Today card, 🔥 streak (Today badge + Trends tiles + `getLoggingStreak`), days-within-goal tile, meal-slot headers, card shadows. Restore errors now name the failing table/row (user hit an import error — details pending). Verified `File.textSync()` valid per v57 docs. Typecheck passes. (Not yet committed.)
- **2026-07-02 (earlier)** — Onboarding now has a **Cancel** (‹) when opened via Edit goal (App tracks `editingGoal`; first-run stays mandatory). Export offers **Save to device** (Android SAF, no share) vs **Share** (`backupFile.ts`: `shareBackup`/`saveBackupToFolder`/`canSaveToFolder`); iOS uses the share sheet's built-in "Save to Files". Typecheck passes. (Not yet committed to git.)
- **2026-07-02** — Added local backup/restore (account-free, OS share sheet + document picker; `db/backup.ts`, `backup/backupFile.ts`) + Settings tab (4th tab). Promoted llm7.io to primary AI. Clearing the meal input now cancels a pending estimate. Star-save on estimate card AND logged meals. Initialised git, pushed to github.com/SudhanshuPanthri/Aahaar (secrets kept out via .gitignore). Typecheck passes.
- **2026-07-02** — Expanded seed to 106 foods (+54 composite dishes) to cut AI calls; added Saved Meals feature (`saved_meal` table + `savedMeals.ts` + LogScreen ☆Save / tap-to-log chips); swapped tab emoji for Ionicons. Fixed "boiled egg" (display user's word, renamed seed egg). Logged cloud-sync request as a "for later" next-up item. Typecheck passes. Note: TypeScript got pruned by `expo install`; restored via `npm install` in mobile/.
- **2026-07-02** — Bottom-tab navigation (state-based: Log/Calendar/Trends) + `ui/theme.ts`, `ui/Progress.tsx`, `db/stats.ts`, three screen files; App.tsx slimmed to shell. Fixed meal display: log now groups items into one meal showing the typed line (not per-ingredient); hardened parse prompt so a quantity binds to one food only. Typecheck passes.
- **2026-07-02** — Splash screen (`expo-splash-screen` config plugin in app.json using `assets/splash-icon.png`, white bg; `App.tsx` holds native splash until fonts+DB ready then `hideAsync`). App display `name` → "Aahaar". Cleared the pre-filled meal input (was demo text). **Enabled llm7.io in `.env`** as a free fallback (`EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.llm7.io/v1`, model `gpt-5.4-mini`) — Groq still primary, llm7 takes over on rate-limit. NOTE: splash config-plugin visuals only apply in a dev/prod build (prebuild), not Expo Go; env changes need `npx expo start -c`.
- **2026-07-02** — Built onboarding + goals: `goals/calc.ts` (Mifflin–St Jeor), `db/profile.ts`, `screens/Onboarding.tsx` (Guided/Custom + live preview, reused as Edit goal). App gates onboarding on first run; Today card now shows progress bars vs goal. Added generic OpenAI-compatible AI provider (`ai/openaiCompat.ts`) wired into parse + estimate chains; recommended free endpoint llm7.io (~150 rpm, no signup). Typecheck passes.
- **2026-07-01 (latest)** — Added save-to-log (`log.ts`: addLogItems/getDayTotals) with a "TODAY" total card + "Add to today" button. Added AI nutrition estimation for DB misses (`estimateMeal` + direct-Groq dev path `groq.ts`). User enabled Groq via `.env`. Switched typography to **Inter** (iOS/SF-inspired) via expo-font. Typecheck passes.
- **2026-07-01 (earlier)** — Built AI parser: Cloudflare Worker proxy → Groq (`worker/`, not deployed), client `remoteParse`, offline `localParse` fallback, `parseMeal` orchestrator. Turned `App.tsx` into a free-text input screen with a **pinned total footer** + scrollable list. App confirmed running on Android emulator.
- **2026-07-01 (earlier)** — Scaffolded Expo app in `mobile/` (SDK 57), installed expo-sqlite + Drizzle, built full DB layer (schema/ddl/client/seed/init) + estimation resolver + demo screen. Verified expo-sqlite API vs v57 docs.
- **2026-07-01 (earlier)** — Wrote seed dataset starter (`data/seed_foods.json`, ~55 foods) and Drizzle schema. Next: scaffold Expo app + seed loader.
- **2026-07-01** — Project kicked off. BRD v0.1 → v0.2. Pivoted from native Swift (no Mac) to React Native + Expo. Locked privacy-first/local-first/on-device SQLite. Added calendar + trends. Wrote TECH_DESIGN.md (schema + AI contract). Confirmed ORM = Drizzle. AI model: first chose local Ollama, then switched to **cloud-hosted** (Groq recommended) via Cloudflare Worker proxy — resolves production hosting. No code written yet.
